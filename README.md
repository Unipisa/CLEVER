# CLEVER - Computational and Linguistic bEnchmarks for the study of VErb argument structuRe 

## Project description
The main goal of the CLEVER Project is to gather evidence on Italian argument structure from three different source of knowledge that are typically used in distinct linguistics subfields: human acceptability judgments, behavioral data, distributional representations.

The main outcome of the project will consist of two types of resources that will be made publicy available: 

- a wide-coverage dataset of sentences covering a series of linguistic phenomena concerning the verb argument structure of Italian verbs, annotated with human judgments and behavioral data;
- neural language models for Italian trained on a cognitively plausible corpus, which will be used to develop and test novel applications for the Italian language and as a source of evidence for investigating the property of the argument structure of Italian verbs.

CLEVER includes two RUs, with long-standing mutual collaborations:
Università di Pisa (UPI)
Università Ca’ Foscari Venezia (UVE)



The project consists of five work packages (WP) arranged into several activities.

  WP1. Corpus, linguistic analyses and dataset specification

  WP2. Training of the Neural Language Model

  WP3. Creation of the Linguistic Dataset

  WP4. Computational modeling and linguistic analysis

  WP5. Project Management

Evaluation resources:
Clever Semantic Minimal Pairs
This benchmark extends current research on the sensitivity to semantic violations in language models. Specifically, we adapted an existing minimal pair benchmark that targets knowledge about prototypical, unlikely, and impossible events (Kauf et al.,2023) to evaluate Italian Large LMs. In turn, they were derived from previous cognitive and neurolinguistic studies by Fedorenko et al. (2020) and Ivanova et al. (2021), respectively. The datasets contain minimal pairs of sentences designed to assess semantic knowledge by manipulating sentence plausibility.
